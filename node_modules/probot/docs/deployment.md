# Deployment

Every app can either be deployed stand-alone, or combined with other apps in one deployment.

> **Heads up!** Note that most [apps in the @probot organization](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aprobot-app+org%3Aprobot&type=Repositories) have an official hosted app that you can use for your open source project. Use the hosted instance if you don't want to deploy your own.

**Contents:**

1. [Create the GitHub App](#create-the-github-app)
1. [Deploy the app](#deploy-the-app)
    1. [Glitch](#glitch)
    1. [Heroku](#heroku)
    1. [Now](#now)
1. [Combining apps](#combining-apps)

## Create the GitHub App

Every deployment will need an [App](https://developer.github.com/apps/).

1. [Create a new GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) with:
    - **Homepage URL**: the URL to the GitHub repository for your app
    - **Webhook URL**: Use `https://example.com/` for now, we'll come back in a minute to update this with the URL of your deployed app.
    - **Webhook Secret**: Generate a unique secret with `openssl rand -base64 32` and save it because you'll need it in a minute to configure your deployed app.
    - **Permissions & events**: See `docs/deploy.md` in the app for a list of the permissions and events that it needs access to.

1. Download the private key from the app.

1. Make sure that you click the green **Install** button on the top left of the app page. This gives you an option of installing the app on all or a subset of your repositories.

## Deploy the app

To deploy an app to any cloud provider, you will need 3 environment variables:

- `APP_ID`: the ID of the app, which you can get from the [app settings page](https://github.com/settings/apps).
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: the **Webhook Secret** that you generated when you created the app.

And one of:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: the contents of the private key you downloaded after creating the app, OR...
- `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`: the path to a private key file.

`PRIVATE_KEY` takes precedence over `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`.

### Glitch

Glitch lets you host node applications for free and edit them directly in your browser. It’s great for experimentation and entirely sufficient for simple apps.

1. [Create a new app on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/new-project).
2. Click on your app name on the top-right, press on advanced options and then on `Import from GitHub` (You will need to login with your GitHub account to enable that option). Enter the full repository name you want to import, e.g. for the [welcome bot](https://github.com/behaviorbot/new-issue-welcome) it would be `behaviorbot/new-issue-welcome`. The `new-issue-welcome` bot is a great template to get started with your own bot, too!
3. Next open the `.env` file and replace its content with
   ```
   APP_ID=<your app id>
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your app secret>
   PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=.data/private-key.pem
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
   Replace the two `<...>` placeholders with the values from your app. The `.env` file cannot be accessed or seen by others.
4. Press the `New File` button and enter `.data/private-key.pem`. Paste the content of your GitHub App’s `private-key.pem` in there and save it. Files in the `.data` folder cannot be seen or accessed by others, so your private key is safe.
5. That’s it, your app should have already started :thumbsup: Press on the `Show` button on top and paste the URL as the value of `Webhook URL`.

Enjoy!

**Bonus:** You can deploy your app using [glitch-deploy](https://github.com/gr2m/glitch-deploy) directly from your terminal or as [continuous deployment](https://github.com/gr2m/glitch-deploy#deploy-from-ci).

### Heroku

Probot runs like [any other Node app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs) on Heroku. After [creating the GitHub App](#create-the-github-app):

1. Make sure you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) client installed.

1. Clone the app that you want to deploy. e.g. `git clone https://github.com/probot/stale`

1. Create the Heroku app with the `heroku create` command:

        $ heroku create
        Creating arcane-lowlands-8408... done, stack is cedar
        http://arcane-lowlands-8408.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:arcane-lowlands-8408.git
        Git remote heroku added

1. Go back to your [app settings page](https://github.com/settings/apps) and update the **Webhook URL** to the URL of your deployment, e.g. `http://arcane-lowlands-8408.herokuapp.com/`.

1. Configure the Heroku app, replacing the `APP_ID` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the values for those variables, and setting the path for the `PRIVATE_KEY`:

        $ heroku config:set APP_ID=aaa \
            WEBHOOK_SECRET=bbb \
            PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/Downloads/*.private-key.pem)"

1. Deploy the app to heroku with `git push`:

        $ git push heroku master
        ...
        -----> Node.js app detected
        ...
        -----> Launching... done
              http://arcane-lowlands-8408.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku

1. Your app should be up and running! To verify that your app
   is receiving webhook data, you can tail your app's logs:

        $ heroku config:set LOG_LEVEL=trace
        $ heroku logs --tail

### Now

Zeit [Now](http://zeit.co/now) is a great service for running Probot apps. After [creating the GitHub App](#create-the-github-app):

1. Install the now CLI with `npm i -g now`

1. Clone the app that you want to deploy. e.g. `git clone https://github.com/probot/stale`

1. Due to an [ongoing issue](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/issues/749) in `now.sh`, a workaround must be applied to the private key before it can be used.
    * You can [modify `package.json`](https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/318#issuecomment-343010573) and base64 encode your private key.
    * You can concatenate a `\n` onto each line of the private key, and then merge the private key onto a single line. Then, you can follow the deploy script without modifying `package.json`.

1. Run `now` to deploy, replacing the `APP_ID` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the values for those variables, and setting the path for the `PRIVATE_KEY`:

        $ now -e APP_ID=aaa \
            -e WEBHOOK_SECRET=bbb \
            -e NODE_ENV=production \
            -e PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/Downloads/*.private-key.pem)"

1. Once the deploy is started, go back to your [app settings page](https://github.com/settings/apps) and update the **Webhook URL** to the URL of your deployment (which `now` has kindly copied to your clipboard).

1. Your app should be up and running! For long term use, create an alias for your robot. After making an alias, you can swap to new deploy URLs with no downtime.

        $ now alias set https://your-generated-url.now.sh https://a-fancier-url.now.sh

1. You can also keep your app running forever, with instant response to webhooks with:

        $ now scale https://a-fancier-url.now.sh 1

## Combining apps

To deploy a bot that includes multiple apps, create a new app that has the apps listed as dependencies in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-probot",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "probot-autoresponder": "probot/autoresponder",
    "probot-settings": "probot/settings"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "probot run"
 },
 "probot": {
   "apps": [
     "probot-autoresponder",
     "probot-settings"
   ]
 }
}
```

## Error tracking

Probot comes bundled with a client for the [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) exception tracking platform. To enable Sentry:

  1. [Install Sentry from Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/sentry) (with [10k events/month free](https://github.com/marketplace/sentry/plan/MDIyOk1hcmtldHBsYWNlTGlzdGluZ1BsYW40Nw==#pricing-and-setup)) or [host your own instance](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) (Students can get [extra Sentry credit](https://education.github.com/pack))
  2. Follow the setup instructions to find your DSN.
  3. Set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable with the DSN you retrieved.
