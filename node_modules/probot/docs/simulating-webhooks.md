# Simulating Webhooks

As you are developing your app, you will likely want to test it by repeatedly trigging the same webhook. You can simulate a webhook being delivered by saving the payload to a file, and then calling `probot simulate` from the command line.

To save a copy of the payload, go to the  [settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) page for your App, and go to the **Advanced** tab. Click on one of the **Recent Deliveries** to expand it and see the details of the webhook event. Copy the JSON from the the **Payload** and save it to a new file. (`test/fixtures/issues.labeled.json` in this example).

Next, simulate this event being delivered by running:

```
$ node_modules/.bin/probot simulate issues test/fixtures/issues.labeled.json ./index.js
```
