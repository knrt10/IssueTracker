If you've ever thought, "wouldn't it be cool if GitHub couldâ€¦"; imma stop you right there. Most features can actually be added via [GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/), which extend GitHub and can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks. Apps are first class actors within GitHub.

## How it works

**Probot is a framework for building [GitHub Apps](http://developer.github.com/apps) in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**. GitHub Apps can listen to webhook events sent by a repository or organization. Probot uses its internal event emitter to perform actions based on those events. A simple Probot App might look like this:

```js
module.exports = robot => {
  robot.on('issues.opened', async context => {
    const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Thanks for opening this issue!' })
    return context.github.issues.createComment(issueComment)
  })
}
```
Check out some of the [featured apps](https://probot.github.io/apps) or [read the docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/) to learn more about writing a new app.

## Contributing

Probot is built by people just like you! Most of the interesting things are built _with_ Probot, so consider starting by [writing a new app](https://probot.github.io/docs/) or improving one of the [existing ones](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aprobot-app&type=Repositories), and check out our [contributing docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) for other ways to get started.
